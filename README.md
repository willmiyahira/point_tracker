## Point Tracker

###### This is a simple application for tracking an number of player's points created using the python package Tkinter. To use, simply click on "Add Player" to add as many players to the game as you want. The names of each of the players can be changed to whatever you desire. By default, they will be set to "Player __" where the __ space will contain a number. To add or remove points for a given player(s), enter the number of points you want to add/remove in the text field above the "Add Points" button. Use the check boxes to select which players will be affected. Then click the "Add Points" or "Remove Points" button to add or remove points from the players you selected. To remove players from the game, select the player(s) to remove using the check boxes and then click the "Remove Player" button.
